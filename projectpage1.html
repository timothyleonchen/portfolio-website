                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>FlyFishCast is a mobile application I designed to help narrow the ambiguity that surrounds fly fishing so that anglers
                    can enhance their experiences on the water.</p>
                <h3>Identifying the Problem</h3>
                <p>I wanted to contribute to the industry of fly fishing and I knew there were several desktop applications that provided
                    fly fishing resources, but the mobile apps that existed left a lot to be desired. It gave me a sense of opportunity, especially
                    when my fishing buddies displayed excitement and intrigue after I mentioned my project. It was something anglers wanted.
                    The challenge that immediately appeared from the beginning and continued throughout the entire process was my struggle to
                    recuse my knowledge and personal experiences with fly fishing from the design.</p>
                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>FlyFishCast aims to provide highly informative fishing reports, weather forecasting and navigation, so anglers can enhance
                    their planning and experiences on the water.<br>We will know this to be true when we see users choose and commit to
                    FlyFishCast in order to ease the process of planning their fly fishing endeavors.</p>

                <h3>Goals for Surveying and Interviewing</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>To better understand users' behaviors in their fly fishing endeavors</li>
                    <li>To understand users' time commitments to fly fishing</li>
                    <li>To learn more about the resources users currently use on their outings</li>
                    <li>To identify what features users are expecting in a fly fishing application</li>
                </ul>

            <div>
                <h3>Survey</h3>
                <p>To kick off my user research I decided to conduct surveys because 1) I had never created a survey and I wanted that methodology
                    to be a part of my research skill set, and 2) I wanted to test my hypotheses and to figure out if I was asking the proper questions.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>13 Questions</li>
                    <li>11 Participants</li>
                    <li>Promoted through personal, work, and social media networks</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Survey Key Insights</h3>
                <p>Trip Planning Behavior :</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>80% of survey participants’ fly fishing trips do not involve traveling to a destination or lodge</li>
                    <li>100% of survey participants’ fly fishing trips rarely or never involve a fly fishing guide</li>
                    <li>73% of survey participants fly fish in freshwater conditions</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Based on the numbers, users typically do not take ambitious fly fishing trips - they do not travel or hire guides but instead,
                    fish locally and find the time to do it. This eliminated my preconceived idea that a resource to help users find guides or book
                    trips in lodges would be a useful feature.</p>
                <p>App Usage Habits :</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>70% of survey participants don’t use a “fly fishing-related” application when they go fishing</li>
                    <li>100% of survey participants check the weather before they go fishing</li>
                    <li>67% of survey participants check water conditions (flows/tides) before they go fishing</li>
                    <li>91% of survey participants don’t currently use a fishing log</li>
                </ul>

                <p>As far as app usage goes, I learned that most of the survey participants don’t use a fly fishing specific app to enhance their fishing,
                    but they do use resources that exist on the market already.<br>I approached these results with pessimism at first and thought “okay, people
                    really don’t need this,” but I readjusted and realized there were still opportunities to fulfill unmet needs elsewhere. I also realized
                    I needed better questions - even a follow up such as, “If no, why not?”</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Interview Key Insights</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Exploration is bittersweet - new fishing spots excite anglers but searching for new spots without more information upfront is risky</li>
                    <li>Weather is still the biggest factor in anglers’ comfortability on the water</li>
                    <li>More accurate resources that help efficiency are desired, such as tips, techniques, fishing conditions</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Fishing reports are the feature that fly anglers want and it appears to outweigh the desire to seek information from guides and fly shops,
                    which was unexpected because I had treated them equally valuable prior to my research. The other obstacle that came from my interviews was
                    how I was going to create features that would outperform what was already being used by anglers.</p>

                <h3>User Personas</h3>
                <p>I created user personas based off of the insights I procured from my user research, but I still wanted them to be a realistic
                    portrayal of a FlyFishCast user. It was difficult to keep my own biases isolated from my personas. One of the ways I attempted to
                    recuse myself from this process was by picking factors I wasn’t as familiar with such as coastal fly fishing and Catskill fly fishing.</p>

                <p>My personas were able to come to life when given a journey. I decided to include my original user flows because I learned valuable
                    lessons from their imperfections.</p>

                <p>Lessons learned :</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Eventually, after I had learned more about design, I opted to have new users go through onboarding prior to account creation</li>
                    <li>At what point did the user agree to location services to have the options for “Current Location Weather”?</li>
                    <li>I had not thought of this previously but it was important to include “Remember Me” or skip buttons, so that returning users had less friction when reopening the application</li>
                    <li>I originally envisioned an interactive map where users could click on a state but realized this would be very limiting in a mobile setting</li>
                </ul>

                <p>While these two design methods helped me visualize the big picture, they immediately created problems for me. It was rock-bottom as a designer.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>I was integrating features that weren’t derived from my research because of my biases (it would eventually overwhelm my navigation system)</li>
                    <li>Features and information could be combined or placed differently to avoid repetition and cluttering; I was complicating the process</li>
                    <li>I failed to include a fishing log that linked to a community, which some participants believed would be a viable feature</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Reducing navigation stress by combining features under one subject, e.g. placing regulations within fishing reports and planning ahead to supply ample learning benefits into fishing reports</li>
                    <li>Simplifying main features, e.g. removing unnecessary pages that aren’t crucial to prototyping or an mvp</li>
                    <li>Adding in a Fishing Log with the vacated space</li>

                <p>Similarly to user interviews, I used affinity mapping to organize all the data from my usability tests. I color coded them by participants.
                    Additionally, I used the Rainbow Spreadsheet by Tomer Sharon to organize even further and prioritize the most pressing issues at hand.</p>

                <h3>Test Report</h3>
                <p>The test demonstrated that the prototype was working properly, but there were several issues that kept it from being exemplary.
                    Listed below is some feedback that was addressed to revise the app.</p>
                <p>Issue 1 : Didn’t realize screens were scrollable/skepticism at how information was displayed<br>Solution(s) :</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Reorganize information in Fishing Reports by creating a new navigation</li>
                    <li>Reformatting Weather so it’s all on one screen</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Issue 2 : Jargon in Fishing Reports confused or concerned experienced anglers<br>Solution(s) :</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Hypothesized hyperlinks or pop-ups for fishing terminology</li>
                    <li>Additional testing proved that the hyperlinks and pop-ups caused too much interruption</li>
                    <li>Rewrote information to give the same messages in a language for all levels</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Issue 3 : Necessary updates for Fishing Report’s overlay<br>Solution(s) :</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Adding search bar and filter icon</li>
                    <li>Replacing placeholders with images</li>
                    <li>Updating section titles and lists to represent a more personalized screen</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Issue 4 : Large icons in Weather were redundant and not recognized as scrollable<br>Solution(s) :</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Reorganize weather information into tables or columns to reduce screen clutter</li>
                    <li>Eliminate excessive scrolling by placing elements strategically on one screen</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Issue 5 : Dates for Fishing Reports<br>Solution(s) :</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Add “as of” or “updated on” dates for Fishing Reports</li>
                    <li>Builds credibility and makes users feel like the information is current</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Application-wide facelift following Material Design Guidelines, Design Language System, and Accessibility Guidelines</li>
                    <li>Reconfigured Fishing Reports to have a navigation system within itself for more organized sections as opposed to fully scrollable</li>
                    <li>Removed flow charts from Onboarding and Fishing Reports because it was confusing users</li>
                    <li>Tested hyperlinks or pop-ups for terminology but concluded to simplify all text to reduce jargon</li>
                    <li>Added date to Fishing Reports, photographs of products and their purchasing options</li>
                    <li>Reformatted Weather Forecasting to reduce wasted screen space with redundant icons and remove scrolling</li>
                    <li>Updated location selection screen to be more personable - specific categories, search bar, filter icon, photographs of locations, etc.</li>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Through my processes, you can see that I learned a lot of lessons, especially about myself and how my biases could severely hinder my research.
                    My ability to reflect on this and make the necessary adjustments in time to gain the most out of my usability testing is an improvement that I am proud of.</p>
                <p>Thank you for reviewing my project on FlyFishCast. What started out as educational tasks has evolved into a humbling, sometimes frustrating,
                    and fulfilling experience.</p>
                <p>Like all UX processes, the work is never finished and there are always ways to improve. I look forward to the
                    future of FlyFishCast and upcoming projects.</p>
